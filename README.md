![Titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/RMS_Titanic_3.jpg)

## Project Overview ðŸš¢
This project explores the Titanic dataset using **statistical analysis** and **deep learning**. The analysis uncovers trends and patterns in the data, while the deep learning model predicts passenger survival based on various features.

### Key Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.
- Apply **statistical tests** to understand feature relationships.
- Build and train a **neural network model** for survival prediction.

## Dataset Information ðŸ“Š
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Key columns include:
- **survived**: Survival indicator (1 for survived, 0 for not)
- **pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- **sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **age**: Age of the passenger
- **sibsp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **fare**: Ticket fare
- **embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
